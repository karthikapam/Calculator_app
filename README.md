# calculator_app


This is my first react native application as part of my react learning.

I have learnt in great deal of understading how to prepare the environment, using package managers on different platforms like macos, linux & windows and also OS related settings. In addition, I also gained knowledge about developer code IDE tools like visual studio editor etc. Furthermore, I got an understanding of emulators, simulators of andriod and IOS.

Here, i made a basic react native application: A calculator. I used various react tools like Button, text, image, stylesheet and etc. I included basic arithmetic operations logic here. I also understood how the packages and dependencies work and how to install them. I checked the app's performance in both andriod and ios simulators and also customised accordingly.

Most importantly, I got an understanding of react native framework and its applications.
